Title: Deterministic Computation of Textbox Metrics

Description: Unlike other tools that dynamically link to the 'Cairo'
    stack, 'freetypeharfbuzz' is statically linked to specific
    versions of the 'FreeType' and 'harfbuzz' libraries (2.9 and 1.7.6
    respectively). This ensures deterministic computation of textbox
    extents for situations where reproducibility is crucial (for
    instance unit tests of graphics).
