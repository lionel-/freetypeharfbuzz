Title: Deterministic Computation of Text Box Metrics

Description: Unlike other tools that dynamically link to the 'Cairo'
    stack, 'freetypeharfbuzz' is statically linked to specific
    versions of the 'FreeType' and 'harfbuzz' libraries (2.9 and 1.7.6
    respectively). This ensures deterministic computation of text box
    extents for situations where reproducible results are crucial (for
    instance unit tests of graphics).
